# GitHub Account Manager (gman)

gman is a command-line tool for managing multiple GitHub accounts on Windows. It allows you to easily switch between different GitHub accounts based on aliases, add new accounts, and remove existing accounts. The tool securely stores the account details in the Windows Credential Manager.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Git command-line tool installed and accessible in the system's PATH
- Go programming language (optional, if you want to build the script from source)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of gman from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/gman/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.
3. Add the location of the extracted archive to the system's PATH environment variable if you want to be able to run the script from any location in the command-line.

Alternatively, you can build the script from source using the Go programming language:

```
go build -o gman main.go
```

## Usage

### Adding an Account

To add a new GitHub account:

```
gman add
```

Follow the prompts and enter the alias, username, and personal access token for the GitHub account. The alias is a user-defined name to identify the account.

### Switching an Account

To switch to a specific GitHub account:

```
gman switch <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username assigned to the account you want to switch to.

### Removing an Account

To remove an existing GitHub account:

```
gman remove <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username assigned to the account you want to remove. You will be asked for confirmation before the account is deleted.

### List Available Commands

To see the available commands and their usage:
